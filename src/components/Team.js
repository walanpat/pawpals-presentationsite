      <h3>Meetings Schedule</h3>
      <p>First Client Meeting: Wednesday, February 3, 6 PM</p>
      <p>Regular development team meetings: Tuesdays, weekly, 5 PM</p>
      <h3> Team Rules</h3>
      <li>Behavior:</li>
      <p>
        Team members will communicate through the GroupMe we have set up. If a
        team member will be late to a meeting, she or he should send a message
        in the GroupMe in advance of the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Team members should respond to messages that pertain to them in the
        GroupMe by the end of the workday that the message was sent, and no
        response will normally be interpreted as the memberâ€™s not knowing the
        answer to the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        If team members are dissatisfied with the work of other members, she or
        he can privately message them and express their concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a team member is unable to do her or his specified role appropriately
        or encounters an obstacle in their role, the team member should ask for
        assistance as soon as the obstacle is realized from other group members
        in the GroupMe.
      </p>
